Hello, 

I am the title-clearer working to clear title for this refinance. (An issue was / A couple issues were / A few issues were ) identified during our title search.

{first issue verbage}

Also, {second issue verbiage} 

Last, 

I will be reaching out to the necessary parties to resolve these issues and expect that all issues will be addressed by {expected clear date}. If you speak to the member, pelase let them know that we may be contacting them for additional information. Please do not ask that they reach out to any third parties to attempt to resolve these issues on there own, as requests from multiple parties can often times cause confusion or delays.

As soon as title is clear, I will email you to advise. Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions or if I can be of any assistance. 

Thank you,
